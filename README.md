# Intro to JavaScript

Today we're going to learn JavaScript! You've used
[Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu), [Blockly](https://code.google.com/p/blockly/)
or completed some lessons on [Code.org](learn.code.org/hoc/1), and now it's time
to move beyond that. We'll review the concepts demonstrated in editors like
Scratch and then start writing **actual** code in JavaScript.

Topics we'll be covering:

* Functions: what are they? how do we use them?
* Variables: how do we store things? what are variables used for?
* Control statements (if, else, while): how can we use these to write complex programs?
